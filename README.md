**The Wild Oasis** - Hotel Management tool, Designed to facilitate employees' work.
It allows the employee to manage bookings, cabins, checkins, checkouts and more.

A single page web app, created by laverging the power of **ReactJs** and many other powerful libraries, And a very awesome "Backend as a service" called **Supabase** and I used **Tanstack Query (React Query)** to manage the remote state, it's one of my favourite libraries.

This is my first real world application, which has most of the features that have to exist in any real world web application like:

- Authentication and Authorization
- Communicating with the outside world by fetching data from an external server
- Server side filtering, pagination and sorting
- Bookmarkable pages
- Notifications system
- User-friendly dashboard with statistics and charts
- Beautiful UI design with dark mode.
- User profile with the possibility of modifying your data.
  And many other feartues.

Another features that i am still working on:

- Create new booking in the application
- Changing cabin price in the application
- Create resturant in the hotel
- Generating pdf invoice for checkouts and mail it to the user
